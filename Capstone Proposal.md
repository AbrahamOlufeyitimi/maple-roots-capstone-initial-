# Project Title
Maple Roots

## Overview


Maple Roots is a spot for new students in Canada to get guidance and help with resources and information as they plant their roots in the country.

### Problem Space


A lot of young people take on the huge challenge to move away from their family and their comfort zones to come to Canada in search of better education and internationally accepted degrees. A lot of them arrive as young adults and have to figure out the new life, new country, new way of learning on their own and they also to face the extra step of setting themselves up correctly in the country so they can fully focus on their studies. Unfortunately, many students miss out or find out late about some of the resources available to them due to lack of information. So Maple Roots aims to bring the resources, information and solutions right to their fingertips so they can feel less overwhelmed.
